    <h1>Taiwan After Dark: Exploring their Night Markets. </h1>
    <h2> While in Taiwan for a study tour, I visited many night markets. They were located in either Kaoshiung or Taipei. All 3 markets were a memorable experience. They were all quite equally crowded. All of the markets had a variety of culinary delicacies to choose from.  Whether it was the seafood the mini pastries, or even the freshly cut fruits. Taiwan’s night market are unique with its food and souvenirs. 
    </h2>
    <h2>A Lucky Attempt in Lihue Night Market. 

    </h2>
    <h2>     When I first entered the market, it was around 6 pm. I saw lots of carnival games and thought that they were rigged. But I ended up trying them out anyway. I'm glad that I ended up trying them out, because that day, I went home with the biggest prize. I tried a variety of things there such as tanghulu, squid, roasted beef, fries, and many more. Taiwan's bobas never fail to disappoint me. They tasted just right. Although cars pass through freely in this night market, it is a little dangerous. Both locals and tourists visit Lihue Night Market one familiar, and the other discovering. 

    </h2>
    <h2>Strolling A Far: Deep into the XiMenDing Night Market. 
    </h2>
    <h2>     XiMenDing is a wide and open night market. Although it's spacious. It is also still very crowded. When I first arrived, I spotted a bunch of tourists from many parts of the world. Ximending's lights call people I like old friends. XiMenDing's night market offers a lot of culinary delicacies, but this market is mostly famous for its shopping districts, such as; clothing, jewelry, accessory stores, shoe stores, etc. XiMenDing also has a Popmart store. Popmart is a store that offers tons of blind boxes. The Popmart here in XiMenDing has 4 floors for us to explore. Other than that, XiMenDing also offers the biggest Adidas and Nike building with over 6 floors. Did you know? If you go deeper into the market, you can go crazy and buy tons of Muji supplies. I felt overwhelmed with the fact that I was only given 2 hours and 30 minutes. 
    </h2>
    <h2>A Market Full of Sweets and Treats</h2>
    <h2>     I thought that I would never be amazed by any other night markets after XiMenDing but, the RaoHe night market had other plants. RaoHe has many snacks to choose from. I bought a black pepper bun, 2 strawberry tanghulus, boba, and dorayaki. RaoHe was nice, although.. the place was quite cramped. RaoHe was the only market that I bought a lot of food in, besides Lihue. RaoHe is a living cookbook, with each stall having different recipes waiting for us to try. 
    </h2>
    <h2>     From all 3 night markets, XiMenDing has my heart. Lihue convinced me to try out every mini-game I saw, while RaoHe filled my stomach to the brim. I will go back to all 3-night markets when I return to Taiwan. Farewell Taiwan, I will miss you and your night markets.
